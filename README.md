## Session Notebooks

### S1P2 2025-2026
This repository hosts guided examples of data-driven analyses for the course Computational Social Sciences. Each notebook demonstrates how to explore, visualize, and interpret datasets to answer socially-relevant questions using modern Data Science techniques.

Notebooks

A. Session 1: DSA Content Moderation. Analysis of a subset of the Digital Services Act Transparency Database.
Highlights:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Proportional analysis of automated detection and decision types
- Interactive and static visualizations (stacked bar charts, heatmaps)
- Insights into platform-specific moderation practices

B. Future Sessions
Subsequent notebooks will explore new datasets and case studies, emphasizing hands-on experience in computational social sciences, including social behavior, governance, and platform analytics.

Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Key packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
