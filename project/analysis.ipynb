    "# Gendered Reception of Politicians in Online Political Discourse\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Online social media platforms have become central arenas for political debate, shaping public perception of political actors. Previous research suggests that women in politics are subject to different forms of evaluation and criticism than their male counterparts, often involving gendered language and personal attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we investigate how the online reception of female politicians differs from that of male politicians using computational methods. Relying on publicly available datasets of political discussions on social media, we analyze textual content and interaction structures to identify differences in sentiment, toxicity, thematic focus, and network dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining natural language processing techniques with graph-based analysis, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of gender bias in online political discourse while critically reflecting on the methodological and ethical limitations of computational approaches.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms play a crucial role in contemporary political communication, enabling direct interaction between political figures and the public. While these platforms can foster political engagement, they also expose public figures to large volumes of unmoderated commentary, including harassment and hate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender bias in political communication has been documented in traditional media, where women are often evaluated based on personal attributes rather than political positions. Online platforms introduce additional dynamics such as anonymity, virality, and network effects, which may amplify these biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the reception of politicians on social media, examining whether female politicians are discussed, criticized, or targeted differently compared to male politicians. Using computational tools, we aim to move beyond anecdotal evidence and provide a systematic analysis of large-scale online discourse."

    "How does the online reception of female politicians differ from that of male politicians in political discussions on social media?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub-questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are comments directed at female politicians more negative or toxic than those directed at male politicians?\n",
    "- Do the dominant topics differ between discussions about female and male politicians?\n",
    "- Are gendered themes (e.g. appearance, legitimacy, personal life) more prevalent in comments about women?\n",
    "- Do negative comments exhibit different interaction patterns or levels of coordination depending on the politician’s gender?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H1:** Comments addressing female politicians exhibit higher levels of toxicity than those addressing male politicians.\n",
    "- **H2:** Topic modeling reveals gender-specific themes, with comments about women more frequently referencing appearance or personal attributes.\n",
    "- **H3:** Toxic comments directed at female politicians form denser or more coordinated interaction clusters.\n"
