    "# Gendered Reception of Politicians in Online Political Discourse\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Online social media platforms are key arenas for political debate, shaping public perception of political figures. While prior research highlights that female politicians often face different forms of evaluation and criticism than their male counterparts, frequently involving gendered language and personal attacks, data availability can limit broad generalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the online reception of selected French political figures, primarily Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, with additional data on a male politician from a similar ideological background. Using computational methods, we analyze textual content and interaction patterns on Twitter to examine differences in sentiment, toxicity, thematic focus, and network dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining natural language processing techniques with graph-based analysis, this study investigates how gender and political alignment intersect in shaping online discourse, while explicitly acknowledging the methodological and ethical limitations inherent in computational social science approaches."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms play a central role in contemporary political communication, allowing direct interaction between political figures and the public. While these platforms can foster political engagement, they also expose public figures to large volumes of unmoderated commentary, including harassment and hate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender bias in political communication has been documented in traditional media, where women are often evaluated based on personal attributes rather than political positions. Online platforms introduce additional dynamics such as anonymity, virality, and network effects, which may amplify these biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the online reception of selected French political figures, primarily Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, with additional data on a male politician from a similar ideological background. Using computational tools, we aim to systematically analyze large-scale online discourse and examine how gender and political alignment intersect in shaping public perception and online commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this study does not aim to establish causal claims about gender discrimination.\n",
    "Rather, it documents systematic differences in online reception under conditions where\n",
    "gender and political alignment are tightly intertwined, using computational tools to\n",
    "characterize large-scale discourse patterns.\n"

    "## 2. Research Question and Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the online reception of Marine Le Pen differ from that of Emmanuel Macron on Twitter, and to what extent can observed differences be associated with gender versus political alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub-questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are tweets referring to Marine Le Pen more negative or toxic than those referring to Emmanuel Macron?  \n",
    "- Do the dominant topics differ between discussions about these politicians?  \n",
    "- Are gendered or personal themes (e.g. appearance, legitimacy, personal life) more prevalent in tweets about Marine Le Pen?  \n",
    "- How does the reception of Marine Le Pen compare to that of a male politician from a similar ideological background?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H1:** Tweets referring to Marine Le Pen exhibit higher levels of toxicity and personal attacks than those referring to Emmanuel Macron.  \n",
    "- **H2:** Differences in online reception are reflected not only in overall toxicity levels,\n",
    "but also in the qualitative composition of toxic language (e.g. insults, identity attacks).\n",
    "- **H3:** Differences in toxicity and interaction patterns persist, though are partially reduced, when comparing Marine Le Pen to a male politician from a similar political orientation.\n"

    "\n",
    "We adopt a computational approach combining text and network analysis on Twitter data mentioning selected French political figures. Our pipeline includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\n",
    "  - Text preprocessing: tokenization, cleaning, normalization\n",
    "  - Sentiment and toxicity classification (pre-trained models)\n",
    "  - Topic modeling for dominant themes\n",
    "- **Graph Analysis**\n",
    "  - Reply and interaction networks\n",
    "  - Centrality, clustering, and coordination patterns\n",
    "- **Robustness Considerations**\n",
    "  - Pre-trained models may encode biases\n",
    "  - Gender and political alignment are partially confounded\n"

    "## Gender Versus Political Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "A key limitation of the comparison between Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron\n",
    "is that gender and political alignment are confounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "To partially disentangle these effects, we compare Marine Le Pen to a male\n",
    "politician from a similar ideological background. While differences in online\n",
    "reception are reduced in this comparison, they do not disappear entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that political alignment explains part—but not all—of the observed\n",
    "negativity gap, leaving room for gendered dynamics in online political discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset limited to Twitter; may not generalize offline\n",
    "- NLP models carry social/cultural biases\n",
    "- Gender and political alignment are confounded; causal inference not possible\n",
    "- Imbalance in tweet counts requires careful interpretation of effect sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This project relies exclusively on publicly available data and does not attempt\n",
    "to identify or profile individual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "All analyses are conducted at an aggregate level, focusing on discourse patterns\n",
    "rather than personal behavior. Particular care is taken in interpreting toxicity\n",
    "scores, which represent probabilistic model outputs rather than objective truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "By emphasizing effect sizes, uncertainty, and robustness, the study aligns with\n",
    "best practices in responsible computational social science.\n",

    "## From Research Question to Empirical Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question guiding this project asks whether differences in online reception\n",
    "between Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron can be attributed to gender, political alignment,\n",
    "or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we adopt a step-by-step empirical strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish a baseline** by comparing overall negativity and toxicity levels between the two politicians.\n",
    "2. **Assess the magnitude** of observed differences using both visualizations and statistical tests.\n",
    "3. **Disaggregate toxicity** into specific dimensions (insults, obscenity, identity attacks).\n",
    "4. **Examine temporal dynamics** to evaluate whether differences are stable or event-driven.\n",
    "5. **Explore textual and structural features** (tweet length, sentiment confidence) to rule out alternative explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections implement this strategy using preprocessed Twitter data.\n"

    "**H2: Personalization & Expressive Effort**\n",

    "\n",
    "This study examined gendered patterns in online political reception using\n",
    "large-scale Twitter data and computational methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that Marine Le Pen is consistently exposed to a more negative and slightly\n",
    "more toxic online reception than Emmanuel Macron. While these differences are\n",
    "modest in magnitude, they are stable across time, toxicity dimensions, and\n",
    "interaction contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, comparisons with a male politician from a similar ideological\n",
    "background suggest that political alignment explains part—but not all—of the\n",
    "observed gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these findings highlight the value of combining quantitative\n",
    "scale with interpretive caution. Computational methods allow us to detect\n",
    "systematic patterns in online discourse, but understanding their meaning\n",
    "requires careful attention to context, limitations, and ethical responsibility.\n"
