    "# Gendered Reception of Politicians in Online Political Discourse\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Social Sciences\n",

    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Online social media platforms are key arenas for political debate, shaping public perception of political figures. While prior research highlights that female politicians often face different forms of evaluation and criticism than their male counterparts—frequently involving gendered language and personal attacks—data availability can limit broad generalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the online reception of selected French political figures, primarily Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, with additional data on a male politician from a similar ideological background. Using computational methods, we analyze textual content and interaction patterns on Twitter to examine differences in sentiment, toxicity, thematic focus, and network dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining natural language processing techniques with graph-based analysis, this study investigates how gender and political alignment intersect in shaping online discourse, while explicitly acknowledging the methodological and ethical limitations inherent in computational social science approaches."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms play a central role in contemporary political communication, allowing direct interaction between political figures and the public. While these platforms can foster political engagement, they also expose public figures to large volumes of unmoderated commentary, including harassment and hate speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender bias in political communication has been documented in traditional media, where women are often evaluated based on personal attributes rather than political positions. Online platforms introduce additional dynamics such as anonymity, virality, and network effects, which may amplify these biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the online reception of selected French political figures, primarily Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, with additional data on a male politician from a similar ideological background. Using computational tools, we aim to systematically analyze large-scale online discourse and examine how gender and political alignment intersect in shaping public perception and online commentary."

    "## 2. Research Question and Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the online reception of Marine Le Pen differ from that of Emmanuel Macron on Twitter, and to what extent can observed differences be associated with gender versus political alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub-questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are tweets referring to Marine Le Pen more negative or toxic than those referring to Emmanuel Macron?  \n",
    "- Do the dominant topics differ between discussions about these politicians?  \n",
    "- Are gendered or personal themes (e.g. appearance, legitimacy, personal life) more prevalent in tweets about Marine Le Pen?  \n",
    "- How does the reception of Marine Le Pen compare to that of a male politician from a similar ideological background?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H1:** Tweets referring to Marine Le Pen exhibit higher levels of toxicity and personal attacks than those referring to Emmanuel Macron.  \n",
    "- **H2:** Topic modeling reveals gender-specific themes, with tweets about Marine Le Pen more frequently referencing appearance or personal attributes.  \n",
    "- **H3:** Differences in toxicity and interaction patterns persist, though are partially reduced, when comparing Marine Le Pen to a male politician from a similar political orientation."

    "## 3. Methodological Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To address our research question, we adopt a computational approach combining text analysis and network analysis on Twitter data referring to selected French political figures, primarily Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, with additional data on a male politician from a similar ideological background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**\n",
    "  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, and normalization)\n",
    "  - Sentiment and toxicity classification using pre-trained models\n",
    "  - Topic modeling to identify dominant themes in tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph Analysis:**\n",
    "  - Construction of reply and interaction networks\n",
    "  - Analysis of centrality, clustering, and coordination patterns among users\n",
    "  - Comparison of interaction patterns across politicians to detect potential gendered or ideological clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Social Science Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "While computational methods allow large-scale analysis, they are not neutral. Pre-trained NLP models may encode social biases, and network structures may reflect platform-specific affordances. Our analysis explicitly considers these limitations, especially given the restricted scope of the dataset and the overlap between gender and political alignment.\n"
