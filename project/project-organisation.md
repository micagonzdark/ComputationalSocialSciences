# Computational Social Sciences Project Plan
## Step-by-Step Plan

~~**Phase 0 – Setup**~~
* ~~Create GitHub repo `HSS_CSS_Project` with folders: `data/`, `notebooks/`, `docs/`.~~
* ~~Review lecture slides and explore TP DSA / Lab DSA datasets.~~
* ~~Set up group communication and preliminary roles.~~

**Phase 1 – Research Question**

* Brainstorm 2–3 CSS questions of interest.
* Check available datasets to ensure the question can be addressed.
* Prepare (question, dataset) pair for professor validation.

**Phase 2 – Data Cleaning & Exploration**

* Load datasets in Python/pandas.
* Explore structure, missing values, and types.
* Clean data minimally and save cleaned version.

**Phase 3 – Feature Building**

* Define relevant variables/features.
* For text: tokenize, count emojis/words, etc.
* For networks: nodes, links, centrality, clusters.
* Add new features to dataset.

**Phase 4 – Initial Analysis**

* Descriptive stats: counts, means, medians.
* Simple visualizations: bar charts, histograms, timelines.
* Identify patterns/trends related to the research question.

**Phase 5 – Documentation**

* Commented notebooks explaining each step.
* Save key graphs and insights.
* README with: objective, dataset, steps, preliminary results.

**Phase 6 – Presentation Prep**

* Summarize findings: what was done, why, results.
* Prepare 3–5 slides with clear visualizations.

💡 **Tip:** You can progress through Phase 4 while waiting for the last group member to join.

If you want, I can also make an **even shorter “checklist version”** that fits in the repo README at the top so it’s super easy to follow day by day. Do you want me to do that?
